This project demonstrates a full machine vision classification pipeline for distinguishing between:
- Shoes
- Sandals
- Boots

The model is trained using 'EfficientNetV2B0', a state‑of‑the‑art lightweight convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet.
The dataset contains 15,000 images, which are split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) using the `split-folders` library.

This project demonstrates real‑world ML engineering skills:
- deep learning  
- data preprocessing & augmentation  
- transfer learning with fine‑tuning  
- metrics & analysis  
- model saving & inference demo  
- handling large image datasets
