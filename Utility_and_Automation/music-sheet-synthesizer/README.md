This project is a lightweight 'sound synthesis tool' that converts a sequence of musical notes into an audible melody.  
It uses 'NumPy' to generate sine‑wave tones and 'simpleaudio' to play them back, simulating a basic digital instrument.

This specific implementation plays the melody of "Mary Had a Little Lamb", but the script can be extended to play any sequence of notes.

What This Project Does

- Defines a dictionary of musical note frequencies  
- Accepts a list of notes with durations  
- Generates sine‑wave tones for each note  
- Concatenates all tones into a continuous waveform  
- Plays back the audio buffer using `simpleaudio`

This demonstrates numerical computing, DSP fundamentals, and audio programming using pure Python.
